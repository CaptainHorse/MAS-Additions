You're probably reading this if you are concerned about your safety due to the usage of executable
	
Regarding the executable, it is safe. You can ask me, I can provide source for the application but not the engine it uses.
	I'm not planning to open-source the engine until I'm done with it.

If you for some reason cannot trust my word, ask a MAS member who has access or seen the engine source and can tell it is safe.
	
If you are a MAS admin or creator and absolutely need to see the engine source, PM me (DatHorse#9516).
