Hello and welcome to using Monika After Story Module, powered by unreleased, in-development Singularity Engine

The main use for this addition/module is the ability to use Python 3 and LUA (with some additional features)

Communication between Ren'Py's Python 2 and the Applications Python 3 can be done multiple ways, multi-platform choices would be sockets or a file for example.

Scripts are kept in the 'scripts' folder, any Python (.py) or LUA (.lua) scripts are automatically loaded from there.
There are 2 example scripts to show you how some things work

OpenAL-Soft library is used for audio playback, only OGG Vorbis sound file types are currently supported.

# Scripting  #

Application loops and functions:
	Start (called once when application starts)
	Tick (called once every second)
	Update (called multiple times per second, varies by performance)
	Render (called as fast as the internal engine loop goes, depending how fast your system is)
	OnQuit (called once when the application is quitting)
	
Bind functions:
	SE.Log("log text") # Log something
	SE.SoundAdd2D("name", "relative path to file") # Add a 2D sound source
	SE.SoundAdd3D("name", "relative path to file") # Add a 3D sound source
	SE.SoundPlay("name") # Play a sound once
	SE.SoundLoop("name") # Loop a sound
	SE.SoundStop("name") # Stop a sound
	SE.SoundPosition("name", (x, y, z)) # Set position for 3D sound source (positive z is behind the listener, negative z is in front)
	SE.AudioEnableHRTF(true/false) # Enable or disable HRTF for 3D sound sources. HRTF makes it easier to hear where something is located (depends on persons ear shape whether certain HRTF works)
	 
Try to write non-blocking code if possible so you won't block the execution of other scripts. Or use Python's threads to get your work off main loops.
ie. don't use never-ending while or for loops in Start function. Treat the Update, Render and Tick functions as big while/for loops for your code.

The engine will try to catch up in missed function calls (ex. Tick could run many times per second for brief moment)
