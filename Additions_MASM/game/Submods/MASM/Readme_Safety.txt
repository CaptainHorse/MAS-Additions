You're probably reading this if you are concerned about your safety due to the usage of executable
	
Regarding the executable, it is safe. You can ask me to provide source for the application but not the engine it uses.
	I'm not planning to open-source the engine until I'm done with it.

If you are a MAS admin or part of dev team, and absolutely need to see the engine source, PM me (DatHorse#9516).
